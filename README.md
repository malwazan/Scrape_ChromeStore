# Scrape_ChromeStore
In this project, I will use Scrapy and Selenium to scrape extensions from Chrome-Store.

You need selenium and Scrapy installed and update chromedriver.exe path in scrape_data.py in order to run the scraper. Just change the category url and it will be ready to scrape all the 100,000+ extensions details.

Any issue then feel free to contact me via my email:
